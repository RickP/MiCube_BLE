# MiCube_BLE

Interfacing a Xiaomi Rubic's Cube to an ESP 32. This is some pretty bad code. I just wanted to make it work.
The decoding stuff is based on the work of [wachino](https://github.com/wachino/xiaomi-mi-smart-rubik-cube).
I just ported it to C without caring about a nice API or optimization.

Here's a video of it in action: https://twitter.com/r1ckp/status/1307636995217387523
